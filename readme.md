# MedInventory

A **backend-heavy medical inventory management system** designed to model **real hospital workflows** with **auditability, safety, and scalability** as first-class concerns.

This project focuses on **correct domain modeling**, **transaction safety**, and **compliance-grade audit trails**, rather than UI-heavy features.

---

## Problem Statement

Hospitals and pharmacies must manage medicines with:

- Multiple batches per medicine
- Different expiry dates
- Strict audit requirements
- Role-based access control
- Zero tolerance for stock inconsistencies

Most simple inventory systems fail to:

- Handle expiry correctly
- Track **who did what and when**
- Prevent partial or invalid stock operations

**MedInventory** solves these problems using **proper data modeling**, **MongoDB transactions**, and **immutable audit logs**.

---

## Core Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication (stateless)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Roles**
- **ADMIN** – system control & reporting
- **PHARMACIST** – stock management
- **STAFF** – medicine consumption

---

### Inventory Management (Real-World Model)

- Medicine master data (**no quantity stored here**)
- Batch-level inventory with:
  - Quantity
  - Expiry date
- FEFO (First-Expire-First-Out) stock issuance
- Partial batch consumption supported

---

### Audit & Compliance

- **Immutable stock logs**
  - `STOCK_IN`
  - `STOCK_OUT`
  - `EXPIRED`
- Every log tracks:
  - Who performed the action
  - When it happened
  - Which medicine & batch were involved

Audit logs are **never updated or deleted**.

---

### Transaction Safety

MongoDB transactions are used for:

- Stock-In
- Stock-Out

This prevents:

- Partial updates
- Negative stock
- Missing or inconsistent audit logs

Either **everything succeeds**, or **nothing changes**.

---

### Background Jobs (Cron)

- Daily auto-expiry of medicines
- Daily inventory alert emails:
  - Medicines expiring within 30 days
  - Low stock (below minimum threshold)

---

### Reports & Metrics

- Monthly medicine usage
- Top consumed medicines
- Expired wastage report

---

### Clean Email System

- Secure password reset via email token
- Inventory alert emails for admins
- Reusable HTML email templates

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Medicine & Batch Are Separate

A single medicine can have:

- Multiple batches
- Different expiry dates
- Different quantities

Storing quantity on the medicine level leads to **incorrect expiry handling**.

**Correct model**
Medicine → Batch → StockLog


---

### Why Audit Logs Are Immutable

Audit logs are **events**, not state.

They are never updated or deleted, enabling:

- Full traceability
- Compliance readiness
- Accurate reporting

---

### Why FEFO (First-Expire-First-Out)

Hospitals must always issue medicines that expire first to:

- Reduce wastage
- Maintain patient safety

Stock-out operations always consume batches sorted by **earliest expiry date**.

---

### Why Transactions Are Mandatory

Stock operations touch multiple documents:

- Batch updates
- Stock logs

Transactions guarantee:

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Failure safety
